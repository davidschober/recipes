## Buffalo Cauliflower

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Description 

So yummy!

### Ingredients 

Cauliflower:

* 1 large head cauliflower (about 2½ pounds), cut into medium and large florets (about 8 cups)
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* Can also add: Garlic powder and paprika

Buffalo Sauce:

* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* ⅓ cup Buffalo-style hot sauce (Frank's Original)

### Directions 

* Heat oven to 400 degrees, and place a rack close to the broiler and another in the middle of the oven. (If your broiler is in a drawer below the oven, no need to move the racks.)
* In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with the oil to evenly coat, then season with salt and pepper. Spread out the cauliflower on a baking sheet in an even layer (arrange flat edges pan-side down for extra browning). Bake the cauliflower on the middle rack, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.
* As cauliflower roasts, make the sauce: Melt the butter with the hot sauce in a medium saucepan or skillet over low heat, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Once melted, turn off the heat, but keep the saucepan on the stove.
* Pull the cauliflower out of the oven, and turn on the broiler. Transfer the cauliflower to the hot sauce-butter mixture, stirring the cauliflower to fully coat with the sauce. Then, using a slotted spoon, transfer the cauliflower back to the baking sheet in an even layer.
* Broil until the cauliflower is singed in spots and cooked throughout, about 5 minutes. (Depending on your broiler, you may need to rotate the pan after 2 or 3 minutes for even cooking.) Serve with yogurt ranch for dipping or drizzling, if desired.

### Notes 

From NYT Cooking.

(Stephanie): We added garlic powder and paprika to cauliflower before baking.

Serve with [Dairy-free ranch dressing](https://davidschober.github.io/recipes/ranch-dressing/ ) (recipe on this site) or some other dipping sauce.

## Castagnaccio

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 1 hour | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

* 500 g di farina di castagne  
* 1 litro di acqua  
* 50 g di zucchero di canna biologico (facoltativo)  
* 150 g di uvetta  
* 20 g circa di pinoli italiani  
* ½ cucchiaio di semini di finocchietto  
* 5 cucchiai di olio extravergine di oliva ligure  
* sale fino marino

### Directions 

* Sciacquate l'uva passa, e lasciatela in ammollo circa 30 minuti in acqua tiepida. 
* In una terrina molto capiente versate tutta la farina di castagne setacciandola, in modo da non creare grumi. Aggiungete lo zucchero, un pizzico di sale fino e l'acqua a filo poco per volta, lavorando delicatamente con una frusta. Quando il composto diventerà omogeneo e morbido, coprite la terrina con un canovaccio e fate riposare tre ore.
* Aggiungete nel composto che si sarà addensato i semini di finocchietto, due cucchiai di olio e incorporate bene mescolando con un cucchiaio di legno. Ungete una teglia rettangolare (25 x 35) e antiaderente con l'olio rimasto, e versatevi la crema di farina di castagne ottenuta. Terminate distribuendo uniformemente sulla superficie l'uvetta scolata e strizzata, e poi i pinoli.
* Cuocete nel forno preriscaldato a 180°C per circa un’ora. Il castagnaccio è pronto quando si stacca dalle pareti della teglia e la parte superiore assume un bel colore dorato, con le caratteristiche crepe

## Stuffed Onions

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Description 

Cipolle Ripiene

### Ingredients 

* 3 medium size potatoes
* 4 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium size onions, minced
* 1lb medium size white onions
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 3 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon of marjoram leaves, minced
* 1 tablespoon of fresh Italian (flat) parsley, minced
* fine sea salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* 1 cup fine unflavoured bread crumbs

### Directions 

* Wash the potatoes, put them with their peel into a pot filled with cold water and boil for about 35 minutes or until tender.
* Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent.
* Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside.
* Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot.
* Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper.
* Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan.
* Sprinkle on the top some breadcrumbs and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden. Let it cool down and serve warm or cool (the day after they are even better!).



## Sweet and Spicy Pecans

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 20 min | Servings: 8 |

### Ingredients 

* Cooking spray
* 2 cups pecans, pieces or halves
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Directions 

* Gather the ingredients
* Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil with cooking spray.
* Spread the pecans on the baking sheet and toast them in the oven until dark and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Stir every 3 or 4 minutes.
* While the pecans are toasting, prepare the coating mixture. Microwave the butter in a large microwave-safe bowl until melted. Stir in the brown sugar, maple syrup, salt, cayenne, and cinnamon.
* Once the pecans are fragrant, remove them from the oven and pour the hot nuts into the coating mixture, reserving the baking sheet. Be careful as it might splutter and hiss. Stir until the nuts are evenly coated.
* Pour the nuts back onto the reserved baking sheet, spreading them out into an even layer.
* Bake for another 10 minutes, stirring after every 3 to 4 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the nuts from the oven and allow them to cool and crisp up on the baking sheet.
* Once cool, break the nuts apart or coarsely chop them.
* Use them in your favorite recipe or simply serve and enjoy!

### Notes 

* Originally from: [https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158](https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158 "https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158")
* If you are very sensitive to spices, you might want to reduce the cayenne. On the other hand, if you’re a pepper enthusiast, feel free to increase it. The amount as written gives the nuts a subtle but noticeable “kick."
* If you don't have a microwave, you can melt the butter in a saucepan on the stove. Remove it from the heat before adding and stirring in the brown sugar and spices.
* You can use other nuts in place of the pecans. Yet, pecans are preferred because their sweet taste goes perfectly with this slightly spicy, slightly savory preparation.
* Store the sweet and spicy pecans in an airtight container at room temperature. They will retain their flavor and stay good up to a week.



## Torta di Patate

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 45 min | Servings: - |

### Description 

Torta di Patate, without sfoglia: Potato pie, recipe without the crust. Use the crust from Torta verde

### Ingredients 

* 4 medium potatoes boiled in their skin, cooled and riced
* 1 egg
* Salt, pepper, nutmeg
* 1/2 c. Grated Parmesan
* 1/2 c. Bread crumbs
* 1/2 c. Milk

### Directions 

* Mix all together
* Place 1/2 mixture in a greased pie pan
* Top with sliced ham and/or mozzarella, if using
* Top with remaining potato mixture
* Top with a film of olive oil
* Bake for 45 min. In a 375 degree oven 
* (another version says 350 for 25 min)



## Torta Verde

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 35-40 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

Dough:

* 3 cups flour
* 1 cup warm water
* 1/2 cup oil 
* 1 T salt

Inside:

* 2 big bunches Swiss chard chopped and sauted. Can substitute spinach
* 1 small chopped onion sautéed with chard (optional)
* 4 small-med zucchini, shredded, squeeze with salt in cheese cloth
* 1/2 bag frozen or 2 cans artichokes chopped fine
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or Romano)(rosa says 1/2 cup) 
* 1/2 cup of rice (minute rice is less fussy)

### Directions 

Dough:

* Mix until smooth dough forms
* Flour surface to roll out dough; divide dough
* Roll out 2 sheets to fit pan top and bottom
  * Bottom sheet is larger than first and should cover the pan with some dough hanging over the sides
  * Top sheet is a little larger than pan
* Oil pan and add cornmeal then add bottom sheet and have some hang over
* Mix inside ingredients all together
* Add inside ingredients to pan, put top dough on and fold over bottom sheet edges with top sheet to form crust
* Make holes in the top to let air escape
* Top generously with olive oil
* Bake until golden brown 35/45 min. 400 degrees
* Shake the pan; torta shouldn't stick when it's done because of the cornmeal

### Notes 

We have several recipes and notes for torta verde. The above recipe should be for one large rectangular pan. But it doesn't list oil in the insides - according to notes, there should be oil, like 3/4-1 cup olive oil.

The chard and artichokes should be chopped, then sautéed. The zucchini should be shredded and used raw (I think). Water should be squeezed out of the veggies after steaming.

For the dough, start with a mound of flour with a hole in middle. Add salt, add oil. Start mixing with hands, adding water a little at a time. Use a dough scraper. Mix until smooth ball. Cover. Not sure how long to let sit.

## Superfood Bread

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 40-60 min | Servings: - |

### Description 

Gluten-free, vegan.

### Ingredients 

* 2 cups of cold water
* 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin seeds
* 1 cup of buckwheat or brown rice flour
* 1 cup of almonds
* 1/2 a cup of sunflower seeds
* 3 heaped tablespoons of psyllium husk powder
* 2 tablespoons of chia seeds
* 2 tablespoons of dried mixed herbs (I used herbs de provence but basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano etc are all great); this equals 6 tsps of herbs
* 1 tsp salt (don't forget salt!)
* salt and pepper to taste

### Directions 

Place the almonds and one cup of the pumpkin seeds in a food processor and blend for a couple of minutes until a smooth flour forms. Transfer this flour into a bowl and stir in the remaining half a cup of pumpkin seeds plus the buckwheat flour, sunflower seeds, psyllium husks, dried herbs and salt. Stir the mix well before gradually pouring in the water.

You’ll then need to let the mixture sit for an hour or so to let it fully absorb all the water and firm up. During which time you can heat the oven to 180C.

Once the mix is nice and firm (I mean really firm, it can’t even be a tiny bit runny – if it is then add another spoon of psyllium) grease the base of a loaf tin with coconut or olive oil, pour the mix in and firmly press it down with a spoon or spatula. Then place the bread in the oven and bake for forty minutes to an hour, until the top begins to brown and you can pull a knife out of the middle without any mix sticking to it. Finally, slice, smother in your favorite toppings and enjoy!

I normally store the bread in the fridge as it makes it last longer, and if you want to freeze it that works too, I normally slice it before freezing first though to make toasting easier!

# Cookies

## Amaretti

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 25-35 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

* 2 1/4 cups almond flour or very finely ground almonds, sifted
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* pinch salt
* 2 large egg whites
* 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* confectioners’ sugar, as needed

### Directions 

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Stack two matching, heavyweight, cookie sheets together. Line with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
* In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, sugar and salt until evenly incorporated.
* In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk egg whites and lemon juice until they hold soft peaks.
* Add beaten egg whites and almond extract to dry ingredients and stir until mixture forms a soft, sticky dough, kneading with your hands if necessary. No need to be gentle here, we’re not making macarons. ;)
* Lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar. Use a small cookie scoop to portion dough into 1-inch balls. Roll into a smooth ball, then roll in powdered sugar. Arrange on parchment or silicon-lined baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between cookies.
* Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until tops are cracked and bottoms are just barely golden (if you are NOT using doubled cookie sheets your cookies will brown much quicker, and will likely only need 25 minutes, so watch them closely). If you prefer crunchier cookies you can give them an extra 5 minutes or so or until the tops begin to brown too.
* Remove from oven; let cool a few minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.



## Brown Butter Sugar Cookies

Prep Time:10 min | Cook Time : 10 min plus 2 hours chilling | Servings: 14 cookies |

### Description 
https://www.barleyandsage.com/brown-butter-sugar-cookies/

### Ingredients

* 1 cup unsalted brown butter, room temperature
* 1 ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon almond extract, optional
* ½ teaspoon lemon juice, optional
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* sparkling sugar, for topping

### Directions

1. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the brown butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and lemon juice and beat for 3-4 minutes until the texture is light and fluffy (it should look much paler than before).
2. Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined. The dough should be wet and sticky.
3. Spoon a generous 3 tablespoons of dough and roll into balls. If desired, roll the tops in sparkling sugar.
4. Cover the dough and chill in the fridge overnight (minimum of 2 hours if you just can't wait).
5. Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a light colored baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Place dough balls at least 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheet (they will spread, I usually only do 6 cookies on a half sheet pan). Place the rest of the cookie dough balls back in the fridge while the first batch cooks.
7. Bake cookies for on the center rack of the oven for 9-11 minute or until the edges are set and the centers are still soft.
8. Remove from the oven and let rest on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.

### Notes 

To make brown butter, melt unsalted butter over medium heat, stirring frequently. Watch closely for the butter to develop brown specs and a nutty aroma. Once you start seeing brown specs, let cook for just a few seconds longer (watch very carefully or it will burn). Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl so that it doesn't continue to cook. Set aside and let cool for about 20 minutes in the fridge until soft and pliable. Note: For every ½ cup (1 stick or 113g), you'll lose about 1 tablespoon (14g) to evaporation while cooking. So you can either add in an extra 1 tablespoon before browning, or if you're browning big batches, just make up the weight difference in your recipe with regular unsalted butter if needed.

Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week (they'll definitely be gone before then though).

The dough will keep in the fridge for up to a week (which is great for just making a couple of warm cookies at a time) just make sure to transfer to an airtight container so it doesn't dry out.

Freeze pre-rolled cookie dough balls in the freezer for up to 6 months.

### Notes 

Biscotti are hard Italian cookies, meant for dunking in coffee. The word biscotti means 'twice-cooked,' because the dough is baked first in logs, then cut and cooked again. 

Stored in an airtight container, these will keep for an extended time.

## Royal Icing

Prep Time:5 min | Cook Time : 0 min | Servings: 3 cups |

### Description 

https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/royal-icing/

### Ingredients

* 4 cups (480g) confectioners’ sugar, sifted (I use and recommend Domino brand);
* 3 Tablespoons meringue powder (not plain egg white powder)
* 9–10 Tablespoons room temperature water
* optional for decorating: gel food coloring

### Directions

1. Pour confectioners’ sugar, meringue powder, and 9 Tablespoons of water into a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat icing ingredients together on high speed for 1.5 – 2 minutes. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 5-10 seconds. If it’s too thick, beat in more water 1 Tablespoon at a time. I usually need 10 Tablespoons but on particularly dry days, I use up to 12-14 Tablespoons. Keep in mind that the longer you beat the royal icing, the thicker it becomes. If your royal icing is too thin, just keep beating it to introduce more air OR you can add more sifted confectioners’ sugar.
2. When applied to cookies or confections in a thin layer, icing completely dries in about 2 hours at room temperature. If icing consistency is too thin and runny, it will take longer to dry. If the icing is applied very thick on cookies, it will also take longer to dry. If you’re layering royal icing onto cookies for specific designs and need it to set quickly, place cookies in the refrigerator to help speed it up. 

### Notes 
Notes from original recipe:
1. When you’re not working directly with the royal icing (for example, you are decorating cookies but you still have some icing left in the bowl that you intend to use next), place a damp paper towel directly on the surface of the royal icing. This prevents it from hardening.
2. Optional Flavors: Feel free to add 1/2 teaspoon of your favorite flavored extract, such as lemon, orange, maple, peppermint, etc when you add the water. Taste after the icing comes together, then beat in more if desired. You can also use 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.




## Soft Cut-Out Sugar Cookies

Prep Time:2 hour, 30 min | Cook Time : 12 min | Servings: 24 cookies |

### Description 

https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-sugar-cookies/

Use [Royal Icing recipe](https://davidschober.github.io/recipes/royal-icing/)

### Ingredients

* 2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed for rolling and work surface
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional, but makes the flavor outstanding)*

### Directions

1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.
4. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.
5. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.
6. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)
7. Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
8. Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or easy cookie icing. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.
9. Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days.

### Notes 
Recipe: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-sugar-cookies/
Notes from original recipe
1. Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes – 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.
2. Room Temperature: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it’s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.
3. Flavors: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.
4. Icing: Use royal icing

## Brown Butter Sugar Cookies

Prep Time:10 min | Cook Time : 10 min plus 2 hours chilling | Servings: 14 cookies |

### Description 
https://www.barleyandsage.com/brown-butter-sugar-cookies/

### Ingredients

* 1 cup unsalted brown butter, room temperature
* 1 ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon almond extract, optional
* ½ teaspoon lemon juice, optional
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* sparkling sugar, for topping

### Directions

1. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the brown butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and lemon juice and beat for 3-4 minutes until the texture is light and fluffy (it should look much paler than before).
2. Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined. The dough should be wet and sticky.
3. Spoon a generous 3 tablespoons of dough and roll into balls. If desired, roll the tops in sparkling sugar.
4. Cover the dough and chill in the fridge overnight (minimum of 2 hours if you just can't wait).
5. Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a light colored baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Place dough balls at least 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheet (they will spread, I usually only do 6 cookies on a half sheet pan). Place the rest of the cookie dough balls back in the fridge while the first batch cooks.
7. Bake cookies for on the center rack of the oven for 9-11 minute or until the edges are set and the centers are still soft.
8. Remove from the oven and let rest on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.

### Notes 

To make brown butter, melt unsalted butter over medium heat, stirring frequently. Watch closely for the butter to develop brown specs and a nutty aroma. Once you start seeing brown specs, let cook for just a few seconds longer (watch very carefully or it will burn). Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl so that it doesn't continue to cook. Set aside and let cool for about 20 minutes in the fridge until soft and pliable. Note: For every ½ cup (1 stick or 113g), you'll lose about 1 tablespoon (14g) to evaporation while cooking. So you can either add in an extra 1 tablespoon before browning, or if you're browning big batches, just make up the weight difference in your recipe with regular unsalted butter if needed.

Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week (they'll definitely be gone before then though).

The dough will keep in the fridge for up to a week (which is great for just making a couple of warm cookies at a time) just make sure to transfer to an airtight container so it doesn't dry out.

Freeze pre-rolled cookie dough balls in the freezer for up to 6 months.

## Flourless Chocolate Cake

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 25 min | Servings: 16 |

### Description 

From Two Peas and Their Pod online blog

### Ingredients 

**For the cake:**

* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 large eggs _slightly beaten_
* 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa powder

**For the chocolate ganache:**

* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Directions 

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease an 8-Inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Cut a piece of parchment to fit the bottom of the pan. Place it in the bottom of the pan and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
* To make the cake, put the chocolate and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft, about one minute. Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. If you need to reheat, do for 10 seconds at a time and stir.
* Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract and stir to combine.
* Add the eggs and stir until smooth. Add the cocoa powder and stir until just combined. Don’t over mix.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the cake for 25 minutes or until the cake has a thin crust on the top and the center registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.
* Let the cake cool on a wire cooling rack for 10 minutes. Loosen the edges of the pan with a butter knife and carefully turn it upside down onto a cake plate or serving plate. The bottom of the cake will now be the top of the cake. Let the cake cool completely.
* While the cake is cooling, make the chocolate ganache. Combine the chocolate and cream in a medium microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the cream is very hot so it will melt the chocolate. I always start with 30 seconds and check it. It might take longer, it just depends on your microwave. Remove from the microwave, and stir until the the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.
* Spread the chocolate ganache glaze evenly over the cooled cake. Let the glaze set up for a few hours before cutting and serving the cake. I always put it in the refrigerator to speed up the process.
* Cut the cake into slices and serve with powdered sugar and raspberries, if desired. This cake is also great with whipped cream or ice cream.

### Notes 

From Two Peas and Their Pod: [https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/ "https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/")

* Bake the cake in an **8-inch round cake pan**. Make sure you grease the pan with nonstick cooking AND line it with **parchment paper**. I also grease the parchment paper after it goes in the pan. You don’t want the cake to stick.
* Make sure you use the best chocolate for the recipe so you get the best chocolate flavor. You can use chocolate chips or chopped up chocolate.
* I use semi-sweet chocolate but if you like darker chocolate, bittersweet would work well too.
* I use **Dutch process cocoa** because it gives the cake a deep, chocolate flavor.
* I melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave, but you can melt it on low in a pan using the stove top.
* Don’t over bake the cake. You want it to be nice and fudgy. It is done when the center reads 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.
* Let the cake cool completely before adding the chocolate ganache glaze.
* After the cake is glazed, let the glaze set up before cutting. I like to put it in the refrigerator for a few hours so the glaze can set up.
* Serve the cake with a dusting of powdered sugar and fresh raspberries. We also like to serve whipped cream or ice cream on the side balance out the rich chocolate cake



## Flourless Chocolate Cake - Rosa

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 45 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

* ½ cup water
* ¼ tsp sea salt
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* 18 oz (2 ¼ cups) bittersweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)*
* 1 cup salted butter, room temperature or Earth’s Balance
* 6 eggs, room temperature
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Directions 

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Grease one 9” round cake pan (or glass pie plate) and set aside. (Note: I always cut a piece of parchment paper into a circle with “handles” and place it on the bottom of the pan. Then I grease the pan with the parchment paper in it).
* In a small saucepan over medium heat combine the water, salt and sugar. Whisk every 60 seconds until completely dissolved and set aside.
* Melt the chocolate chips (in the microwave or in a double boiler) and pour into the bowl of a standing mixer.
* Cut the butter into 1 TBS pieces and beat it into the chocolate, 1 piece at a time.
* Mix in the warm sugar/water mixture until combined.
* Slowly beat in the eggs, one at a time until completely smooth.
* Add vanilla and mix until just combined.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
* Put the cake pan in a larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water until it reaches halfway up the sides of your cake pan. Be very careful not to get water into the cake! I like to put the pan with the cake in it on the oven rack before pouring the water. That way I just have to slide it in and close the door!
* Bake cake in the water bath at 300 degrees F for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet, but the edge will look done.
* Remove the cake from the water bath and let it cool on a wire rack.
* Chill cake overnight (or for at least 6 hours) in the pan!
* Carefully lift the parchment paper out of the pan and the cake with it. Put it on a serving plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar! Serve with fresh berries, ice cream, etc!

## Royal Icing

Prep Time:5 min | Cook Time : 0 min | Servings: 3 cups |

### Description 

https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/royal-icing/

### Ingredients

* 4 cups (480g) confectioners’ sugar, sifted (I use and recommend Domino brand);
* 3 Tablespoons meringue powder (not plain egg white powder)
* 9–10 Tablespoons room temperature water
* optional for decorating: gel food coloring

### Directions

1. Pour confectioners’ sugar, meringue powder, and 9 Tablespoons of water into a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat icing ingredients together on high speed for 1.5 – 2 minutes. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 5-10 seconds. If it’s too thick, beat in more water 1 Tablespoon at a time. I usually need 10 Tablespoons but on particularly dry days, I use up to 12-14 Tablespoons. Keep in mind that the longer you beat the royal icing, the thicker it becomes. If your royal icing is too thin, just keep beating it to introduce more air OR you can add more sifted confectioners’ sugar.
2. When applied to cookies or confections in a thin layer, icing completely dries in about 2 hours at room temperature. If icing consistency is too thin and runny, it will take longer to dry. If the icing is applied very thick on cookies, it will also take longer to dry. If you’re layering royal icing onto cookies for specific designs and need it to set quickly, place cookies in the refrigerator to help speed it up. 

### Notes 
Notes from original recipe:
1. When you’re not working directly with the royal icing (for example, you are decorating cookies but you still have some icing left in the bowl that you intend to use next), place a damp paper towel directly on the surface of the royal icing. This prevents it from hardening.
2. Optional Flavors: Feel free to add 1/2 teaspoon of your favorite flavored extract, such as lemon, orange, maple, peppermint, etc when you add the water. Taste after the icing comes together, then beat in more if desired. You can also use 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.




## Soft Cut-Out Sugar Cookies

Prep Time:2 hour, 30 min | Cook Time : 12 min | Servings: 24 cookies |

### Description 

https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-sugar-cookies/

Use [Royal Icing recipe](https://davidschober.github.io/recipes/royal-icing/)

### Ingredients

* 2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed for rolling and work surface
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional, but makes the flavor outstanding)*

### Directions

1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.
4. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.
5. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.
6. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)
7. Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
8. Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or easy cookie icing. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.
9. Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days.

### Notes 
Recipe: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-sugar-cookies/
Notes from original recipe
1. Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes – 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.
2. Room Temperature: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it’s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.
3. Flavors: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.
4. Icing: Use royal icing

## Pan-Seared Cod with Lemon-Caper Pan Sauce

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 15 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

- 2 white fish fillets, (each 5 to 6 ounce) such as Pacific cod, lingcod, or rockfish
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour for dusting (gluten-free)
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons small capers, drained
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- Crusty bread for serving

### Directions 

#### Prep the Fish

Sprinkle the fish generously with salt and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes or refrigerate for up to 1 hour. Rinse the fish and pat very dry with paper towels. Put the flour and beaten egg into 2 separate bowls and season each with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dust the fish with flour, tapping off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg. Dust the fish with flour, once again, tapping off any excess.

Cook the Fish In a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the fish and cook without disturbing until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. Transfer the fish to a platter. Pour off the oil and wipe out the skillet.

#### Make the Pan Sauce and Serve

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, the garlic, and capers to the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and ¼ cup water. Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and cook, shaking and swirling the pan occasionally until the sauce is emulsified. Stir in the lemon zest, then season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.

Return the fish to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and turn the fillets to coat in the sauce. Divide the fillets between 2 plates. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve with crusty bread.

#### Pair it Up

Look for a medium-bodied white wine with some acidity to balance the richness of this herb-infused butter sauce. Sauvignon blanc from California or Argentina is always a good choice.

#### Level it Up

This preparation works well with halibut, sablefish, or salmon fillets.

#### Change it Up

Fold flaked fish and the pan sauce into warm pasta, adding a few tablespoons of broth or butter to add moisture and richness.

#### Lighten it Up

Serve steamed or sautéed broccoli alongside.

## Chicken Piccata

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

* 2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4
* 2 tablespoons flour (all purpose or plain)
* 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Cracked pepper

**For The Sauce:**

* Light spray of cooking oil
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 teaspoons butter (or oil)
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 1 1/4 cup chicken broth (stock)
* 1/2 cup milk (full fat or 2% -- or use reduced fat cream or heavy cream)
* 1/2 cup finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons capers (plus 2 tablespoons extra to garnish)
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with 1 tablespoon of water
* 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice -- juice of 1 lemon (adjust to your tastes)
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley

### Directions 

* Lightly spray pan/skillet with a light coating of cooking oil spray and heat over medium-hight heat. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and parmesan cheese. Season the chicken with salt and pepper; dredge in the flour mixture; shake off excess and set aside.
* Heat the 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 teaspoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until butter has melted and pan is hot. Fry the chicken until golden on each side and cooked through and no longer pink (about 3-4 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer onto a warm plate.
* Add the garlic to the oil in the pan (spray with a light coating of oil if needed) and fry until fragrant (about 1 minute). Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the broth and milk (or cream). Bring the sauce to a boil; season with salt and pepper to your taste; add in the parmesan cheese and capers and allow sauce to simmer for about 2 minutes until thicker. (If the sauce is too runny for your liking, add the cornstarch/water mixture into the centre of the pan and mix through fast to combine into the sauce. It will begin to thicken immediately).
* Pour in the lemon juice, allow to simmer for a further minute to combine. Add the chicken back into the pan to serve, or serve over steamed vegetables, zucchini noodles or cooked pasta with the sauce. Top with extra capers to garnish, lemon slices and parsley.



## Cozy Butternut, Sweet Potato, and Red Lentil Stew

Prep Time:20 min | Cook Time : 30 min | Servings: 11 cups |

### Description 

From Oh She Glows: Butternut squash, red lentils, and sweet potato are wrapped in a lightly sweet and creamy coconut and tomato broth accented with spicy notes of turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and garlic. Apple cider vinegar provides a tangy brightness to bring everything together. This stew tastes better the next day once the flavors have had a chance to mingle.

### Ingredients 

####### FOR THE STEW:

* 2 tablespoons (30 mL) extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced (about 2 cups/280 g)
* 3 to 4 large garlic cloves, minced
* 3 cups (400 g) peeled, seeded, and diced butternut squash*
* 1 large sweet potato (450 g), peeled and diced (2 1/2 cups/340 g)*
* 3 cups (750 mL) low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can diced tomatoes
* 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can light coconut milk
* 1/2 cup (100 g) dried red lentils, rinsed**
* 3 tablespoons (45 mL) tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more if you like heat
* Fine sea salt, to taste (I use 1 1/2 teaspoons pink salt)
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 3 teaspoons (15 mL) apple cider vinegar, or to taste
* 1 bunch chard, stemmed and finely chopped***

####### OPTIONAL ACCOMPANIMENTS:

* Fresh cilantro or parsley, minced
* Cooked rice
* Garlic powder and chili powder

### Directions 

1. To a large pot, add the oil, onion, and garlic. Stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened.
2. Add the squash and sweet potato and stir to combine. Add a pinch of salt and continue sautéing for a few minutes longer.
3. Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with juices), coconut milk, lentils, tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. (If you are spice-shy, feel free to add half the amount to start and increase from there after cooking, to taste.) Stir well to combine.
4. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir again, and simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potato are fork-tender. Reduce the heat if necessary.
5. Add the apple cider vinegar to taste. Adjust the other seasonings if desired.
6. Optional step: Using a handheld immersion blender, blend the stew for only 2 to 3 seconds (any more and you’ll blend too much of the veggies). This thickens the broth.
7. Stir in the chard, and cook for another couple minutes until the greens are wilted.
8. Scoop some cooked rice onto the bottom of a bowl and then ladle the stew overtop. Garnish with minced cilantro or parsley and a good dusting of garlic and chili powder, if desired.
9. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days, and they freeze beautifully too.

### Notes 

\* Make sure to dice the squash and potato very small (about the size of almonds), as this will expedite cooking. Also, if you are short on time, you can skip peeling the butternut squash as the skin is edible. (I don’t recommend skipping peeling the potato, though.)

\** You can swap the red lentils for 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can chickpeas (drained and rinsed).

\*** You can swap the chard for 5 ounces of baby spinach or a bunch of kale (stemmed). I recommend chopping the greens into small bite-size pieces for easier eating.

### Description 
From Epicurious: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/horseradish-crusted-beef-tenderloin-232147

### Ingredients

* 1 (3 1/2-lb) trimmed center-cut beef tenderloin roast, tied
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 lb fresh horseradish, peeled and coarsely grated (1 cup; see cooks' note, below)
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

### Directions

Step 1
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.

Step 2
Pat tenderloin dry, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Step 3
Straddle a 17- by 12-inch flameproof heavy roasting pan across 2 burners and heat 3 tablespoons oil in pan over high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown tenderloin on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Remove from heat and transfer meat to a cutting board to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Put a lightly oiled metal rack inside roasting pan.

Step 4
While meat cools, toss horseradish with remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Rub meat all over with mustard, then transfer to rack in roasting pan and coat top and sides of meat with horseradish, pressing to help adhere.

Step 5
Roast tenderloin until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of meat registers 120°F, 25 to 35 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to cutting board and cool, uncovered, to room temperature, about 45 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to at least 130°F before cooling.)

Step 6
Remove and discard string. Cut tenderloin into thick slices.




### Notes 
If fresh horseradish is unavailable, substitute 3/4 cup drained bottled white horseradish. Rinse well in a sieve, then squeeze very dry in 3 or 4 layers of paper towels.

## Lentil Loaf

Prep Time:60 min | Cook Time : 1 hour | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

* 1.5 cups brown lentils
* 2 onions, chopped
* 2 large cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
* 3/4 cup walnuts
* 1 large carrot, cut into small pieces
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 2 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon unsweetened almond or soy milk
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons oregano
* 2 teaspoons thyme
* 2 teaspoons rosemary
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
* salt
* black pepper

### Directions 

* First, cook the lentils according to the instructions on the package. Then put about 6 tablespoons of the cooked lentils aside. You'll need them later on to give the lentil loaf a bit more texture. 
* Sauté the onion and garlic for about 2 minutes. Then add the chopped carrots and cook them for another 3 minutes. 
* Put all ingredients except the spices into a blender or food processor and blend until you have a sticky but chunky mixture. It's very important that you make sure to not overdo it, so you still got some texture.
* Add the remaining lentils and season with thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, and fresh parsley.
* Place the mixture into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Make sure to let the parchment paper overlap the loaf pan, so it's easier to remove the lentil loaf once it's done. 
* Bake for 60 minutes at 350°F. 
* Let the lentil loaf cool down for a bit in the loaf pan before serving it. 

### Notes 

* Recipe recommends making the lentil loaf the night before and reheating it on the next day (at 350°F for about 20 minutes). This way it will be much firmer.
* Properly stored it will keep up to 5 days in the fridge and 8 weeks in the freezer.

## Pan-Seared Cod with Lemon-Caper Pan Sauce

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 15 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

- 2 white fish fillets, (each 5 to 6 ounce) such as Pacific cod, lingcod, or rockfish
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour for dusting (gluten-free)
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons small capers, drained
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- Crusty bread for serving

### Directions 

#### Prep the Fish

Sprinkle the fish generously with salt and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes or refrigerate for up to 1 hour. Rinse the fish and pat very dry with paper towels. Put the flour and beaten egg into 2 separate bowls and season each with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dust the fish with flour, tapping off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg. Dust the fish with flour, once again, tapping off any excess.

Cook the Fish In a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the fish and cook without disturbing until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. Transfer the fish to a platter. Pour off the oil and wipe out the skillet.

#### Make the Pan Sauce and Serve

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, the garlic, and capers to the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and ¼ cup water. Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and cook, shaking and swirling the pan occasionally until the sauce is emulsified. Stir in the lemon zest, then season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.

Return the fish to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and turn the fillets to coat in the sauce. Divide the fillets between 2 plates. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve with crusty bread.

#### Pair it Up

Look for a medium-bodied white wine with some acidity to balance the richness of this herb-infused butter sauce. Sauvignon blanc from California or Argentina is always a good choice.

#### Level it Up

This preparation works well with halibut, sablefish, or salmon fillets.

#### Change it Up

Fold flaked fish and the pan sauce into warm pasta, adding a few tablespoons of broth or butter to add moisture and richness.

#### Lighten it Up

Serve steamed or sautéed broccoli alongside.

Roast on the bottom rack until the vegetables are tender and the tofu is crisp underneath, 30 to 35 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, toss the sliced onion with the vinegar, remaining ¼ teaspoon chili powder and a pinch of salt. Serve the hash topped with the pickled onions and any additional toppings you like.

### Notes 

From New York Times Cooking. 

We use regular onion, add cauliflower, and add fried eggs. We don't usually do the pickled onions, though that would be yummy.

* **1 tbsp** cumin
* **1 tbsp** onion powder
* **1 tbsp** garlic powder
* **1 tbsp** oregano
* **½ tbsp** black pepper

### Directions 

1. Preheat oven to 375° F.
2. Spread the sweet potatoes out on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and taco seasoning, toss until combined. Cook potatoes on center rack until tender, about 25 minutes. While the potatoes are still warm, toss them with the black beans.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium sized bowl, mix all ingredients for the quick slaw.
4. To serve place a scoop of the sweet potato mixture into a warmed tortilla shell. Top with quick slaw, crumbled goat cheese, a scoop of guacamole and a drizzle of vegan queso.

## Ravioli

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Ingredients 

DOUGH

* 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 large eggs, plus 1 for egg wash
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Cornmeal, for dusting

Gluten-free:

* substitute gluten-free all-purpose flour
* add 2 tsp per cup of flour of Xantham gum (if not already in the flour you are using)
* 1 additional egg

FILLING

Spinach and Ricotta Filling

* 1 lb chopped spinach
  * Use frozen, microwave until thawed and squeeze all liquid out; almost dry
* 1 lb ricotta
* 1 egg
* 1/2 c. grated cheese
* Salt, pepper
* Dash of nutmeg

Mushroom filling

* Mixed mushrooms - baby bellas, shitake, chanterelles, etc. (whatever is available, but not white). Diced.
* Garlic, diced
* Salt
* Fresh sage, chopped

### Directions 

Filling:

Spinach/Ricotta: Mix all ingredients

Mushroom filling:

* Saute garlic in oil
* Add mushrooms, cook down on med/high heat. Liquid should boil off, but you may need to spoon out
* Add salt as you go
* Chopped sage at the end for a few minutes

Dough/Ravioli Assembly

Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed.

Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. 

Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they'll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve.

### Notes 

Stephanie's notes: We didn't use cornmeal, just floured surface. Freezing during prep helps dry out the ravioli and keeps them from sticking to each other.

We put the ravioli in the water in batches. Remove with slotted spoon into serving dish, adding sauce in layers.

* 50 g di zucchero di canna biologico (facoltativo)  
* 150 g di uvetta

### Directions 

* Sciacquate l'uva passa, e lasciatela in ammollo circa 30 minuti in acqua tiepida. 
* In una terrina molto capiente versate tutta la farina di castagne setacciandola, in modo da non creare grumi. Aggiungete lo zucchero, un pizzico di sale fino e l'acqua a filo poco per volta, lavorando delicatamente con una frusta. Quando il composto diventerà omogeneo e morbido, coprite la terrina con un canovaccio e fate riposare tre ore.

Ungete una teglia rettangolare (25 x 35) e antiaderente con l'olio rimasto, e versatevi la crema di farina di castagne ottenuta. Terminate distribuendo uniformemente sulla superficie l'uvetta scolata e strizzata, e poi i pinoli.

## Potato Pancakes

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: 24 pancakes |

### Description 

We make these for our ornament exchange which we started to do around 2019/2020. Used to get them at Christkindl market in Chicago.

### Ingredients 

* 1 medium onion, peeled
* 4 large Idaho or russet potatoes (about 3½ pounds), peeled
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
* Applesauce and/or sour cream, for serving

### Directions 

###### **Step 1**

Preheat oven to 200°F. Place 2 nonstick baking sheets in oven.

###### **Step 2**

Using box grater or food processor fitted with grating disc, coarsely grate onion and place in colander set in sink. Coarsely grate potatoes, add to colander, and set aside to drain.

###### **Step 3**

In large mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs, then whisk in flour.

###### **Step 4**

Press potatoes and onion to extract as much liquid as possible, then add to egg/flour mixture. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using wooden spoon or hands, mix well, but do not overwork.

###### **Step 5**

In heavy-bottomed, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter until hot but not smoking. Drop 4 scant ¼-cup portions of potato mixture into pan and flatten with spatula to form four 3-inch pancakes.

###### **Step 6**

Fry until bottoms are golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then turn over and fry until golden-brown and crisp, an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season immediately with salt and pepper. Keep warm on baking sheets in oven while making remaining pancakes.

###### **Step 7**

Using paper towels, carefully wipe out pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter and fry 4 more pancakes. Repeat with remaining batter, wiping out pan and adding 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter before each batch.

###### **Step 8**

Serve pancakes hot with applesauce and/or sour cream.

### Notes 

Use gluten-free flour if needed. We added baking powder to the recipe.

## Cozy Butternut, Sweet Potato, and Red Lentil Stew

Prep Time:20 min | Cook Time : 30 min | Servings: 11 cups |

### Description 

From Oh She Glows: Butternut squash, red lentils, and sweet potato are wrapped in a lightly sweet and creamy coconut and tomato broth accented with spicy notes of turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and garlic. Apple cider vinegar provides a tangy brightness to bring everything together. This stew tastes better the next day once the flavors have had a chance to mingle.

### Ingredients 

####### FOR THE STEW:

* 2 tablespoons (30 mL) extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced (about 2 cups/280 g)
* 3 to 4 large garlic cloves, minced
* 3 cups (400 g) peeled, seeded, and diced butternut squash*
* 1 large sweet potato (450 g), peeled and diced (2 1/2 cups/340 g)*
* 3 cups (750 mL) low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can diced tomatoes
* 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can light coconut milk
* 1/2 cup (100 g) dried red lentils, rinsed**
* 3 tablespoons (45 mL) tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more if you like heat
* Fine sea salt, to taste (I use 1 1/2 teaspoons pink salt)
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 3 teaspoons (15 mL) apple cider vinegar, or to taste
* 1 bunch chard, stemmed and finely chopped***

####### OPTIONAL ACCOMPANIMENTS:

* Fresh cilantro or parsley, minced
* Cooked rice
* Garlic powder and chili powder

### Directions 

1. To a large pot, add the oil, onion, and garlic. Stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened.
2. Add the squash and sweet potato and stir to combine. Add a pinch of salt and continue sautéing for a few minutes longer.
3. Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with juices), coconut milk, lentils, tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. (If you are spice-shy, feel free to add half the amount to start and increase from there after cooking, to taste.) Stir well to combine.
4. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir again, and simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potato are fork-tender. Reduce the heat if necessary.
5. Add the apple cider vinegar to taste. Adjust the other seasonings if desired.
6. Optional step: Using a handheld immersion blender, blend the stew for only 2 to 3 seconds (any more and you’ll blend too much of the veggies). This thickens the broth.
7. Stir in the chard, and cook for another couple minutes until the greens are wilted.
8. Scoop some cooked rice onto the bottom of a bowl and then ladle the stew overtop. Garnish with minced cilantro or parsley and a good dusting of garlic and chili powder, if desired.
9. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days, and they freeze beautifully too.

### Notes 

\* Make sure to dice the squash and potato very small (about the size of almonds), as this will expedite cooking. Also, if you are short on time, you can skip peeling the butternut squash as the skin is edible. (I don’t recommend skipping peeling the potato, though.)

\** You can swap the red lentils for 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can chickpeas (drained and rinsed).

\*** You can swap the chard for 5 ounces of baby spinach or a bunch of kale (stemmed). I recommend chopping the greens into small bite-size pieces for easier eating.
