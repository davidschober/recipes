# Sauces

## Paolo's sauce

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 45 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

* 1 large onion chopped and sautéed until translucent
* Olive oil (quello buono)
* 1 Large can of crushed tomatoes
* 1 Pomì of strained tomatoes
* Salt, pepper to taste
* Rosemary (fresh if possible)

### Directions

* Cover the bottom of the pan with oil on medium heat
* When oil is beginning to sizzle add the onion and rosemary.
* Stir so onion and rosemary don’t burn.
* Add tomatoes salt and pepper.
* Bring everything to a boil and then lower heat and simmer for 40/45 minutes and voilà
* Keep the can to add water to the sauce as needed.
* Obviously medium heat and simmer is not the same for all stoves so you have to play with it

### Notes

My mom always added butter at the end to give it a more velvety taste. I haven’t done it but it’s an option
