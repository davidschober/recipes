## Castagnaccio 
### Ingredients
* 500 g di farina di castagne  
* 1 litro di acqua  
* 50 g di zucchero di canna biologico (facoltativo)  
* 150 g di uvetta  
* 20 g circa di pinoli italiani  
* ½ cucchiaio di semini di finocchietto  
* 5 cucchiai di olio extravergine di oliva ligure  
* sale fino marino

### Directions
* Sciacquate l'uva passa, e lasciatela in ammollo circa 30 minuti in acqua tiepida. 
* In una terrina molto capiente versate tutta la farina di castagne setacciandola, in modo da non creare grumi. Aggiungete lo zucchero, un pizzico di sale fino e l'acqua a filo poco per volta, lavorando delicatamente con una frusta. Quando il composto diventerà omogeneo e morbido, coprite la terrina con un canovaccio e fate riposare tre ore.
* Aggiungete nel composto che si sarà addensato i semini di finocchietto, due cucchiai di olio e incorporate bene mescolando con un cucchiaio di legno. Ungete una teglia rettangolare (25 x 35) e antiaderente con l'olio rimasto, e versatevi la crema di farina di castagne ottenuta. Terminate distribuendo uniformemente sulla superficie l'uvetta scolata e strizzata, e poi i pinoli.
* Cuocete nel forno preriscaldato a 180°C per circa un’ora. Il castagnaccio è pronto quando si stacca dalle pareti della teglia e la parte superiore assume un bel colore dorato, con le caratteristiche crepe

### Notes

Original recipe in Italian:

Per la base:

* 500 grammi di farina di grano tenero tipo “0”
* ½ cubetto di lievito di birra
* 250 g di acqua
* Olio extravergine di oliva ligure
* 2 cucchiaini di sale fino marino (15/20 gr)
* 1 goccia di miele biologico

Per il condimento

* 1 kg di pomodori pelati
* 10 acciughe sotto sale
* 2 cipolle dolci di media grandezza
* 2 cucchiai di olive taggiasche
* Capperi sotto sale
* Origano
* Olio extravergine di oliva ligure

Directions

* Mettere la farina in una terrina, aggiungere il sale fino e mescolare. Sciogliere, il lievito e il miele (che serve ad attivare il lievito) in una tazza con acqua tiepida, mescolando; versare sulla farina e impastare. Lavorare in modo da ottenere un composto omogeneo, molto morbido, leggermente appiccicoso. Trasferire la pasta nella teglia, unta precedentemente con 2/3 cucchiai di olio e lasciarla lievitare, in un luogo tiepido, al riparo da correnti, per 45 minuti circa.
* Preparare nel frattempo il condimento: cuocere dolcemente in olio extra vergine di oliva le cipolle tagliate sottili; quando iniziano ad appassire, unire i pomodori pelati e spezzettati, far cuocere fino a completa evaporazione dell'acqua, aggiungere eventualmente un pochino di sale. Dissalare e diliscare le acciughe, lavarle e asciugarle adagiandole su carta da cucina.
* Stendere la pasta aiutandosi con le mani leggermente unte, senza toglierla dalla teglia. Lasciarla di nuovo lievitare altri 45 minuti. Distribuire la salsa in maniera uniforme, aggiungere le acciughe, i capperi già sciacquati e asciutti, le olive e una spolverata di origano; cospargere di olio extravergine di oliva e infornare a 250° per circa 20/30 minuti, fino a che il bordo della pizza non sarà dorato.

- 1 cup fine unflavoured bread crumbs

### Directions
- Wash the potatoes, put them with their peel into a pot filled with cold water and boil for about 35 minutes or until tender.
- Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent.
- Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside.

- Sprinkle on the top some breadcrumbs and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden. Let it cool down and serve warm or cool (the day after they are even better!).

## Torta di Patate 
### Description

Torta di Patate, without sfoglia: Potato pie, recipe without the crust. Use the crust from Torta verde

### Ingredients

* 4 medium potatoes boiled in their skin, cooled and riced
* 1 egg
* Salt, pepper, nutmeg
* 1/2 c. Grated Parmesan
* 1/2 c. Bread crumbs
* 1/2 c. Milk

### Directions

* Top with sliced ham and/or mozzarella, if using
* Top with remaining potato mixture
* Top with a film of olive oil
* Bake for 45 min. In a 375 degree oven 
* (another version says 350 for 25 min)

## Torta Verde 
### Ingredients

Dough:

* 3 cups flour
* 1 cup warm water
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 T salt

Inside:

* 2 big bunches Swiss chard chopped and steamed. Can substitute spinach
* 4 small-med zucchini, shredded
* 1/2 bag frozen or 2 cans artichokes chopped fine
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or Romano)
* Handful of rice

### Directions

Dough:

* Mix until smooth dough forms
* Flour surface to roll out dough; divide dough
* Roll out 2 sheets to fit pan top and bottom
  * Bottom sheet is larger than first and should cover the pan with some dough hanging over the sides
  * Top sheet is a little larger than pan
* Oil pan and add cornmeal then add bottom sheet and have some hang over
* Mix inside ingredients all together
* Add inside ingredients to pan, put top dough on and fold over bottom sheet edges with top sheet to form crust
* Make holes in the top to let air escape
* Top generously with olive oil
* Bake until golden brown 35/40 min. 350-400 degrees
* Other notes say 400 degrees, 45 minutes. 
* Shake the pan; torta shouldn't stick when it's done because of the cornmeal

### Notes

We have several recipes and notes for torta verde. The above recipe should be for one large rectangular pan. But it doesn't list oil in the insides - according to notes, there should be oil, like 3/4-1 cup olive oil.

The chard and artichokes should be chopped, then steamed. The zucchini should be shredded and used raw (I think). Water should be squeezed out of the veggies after steaming.

For the dough, start with a mound of flour with a hole in middle. Add salt, add oil. Start mixing with hands, adding water a little at a time. Use a dough scraper. Mix until smooth ball. Cover. Not sure how long to let sit.

# Breakfast

## Nonna Pancakes 
### Ingredients

* 1 egg
* 1 banana
* cinnamon

### Directions

* Mash banana and mix with egg
* Add cinnamon to taste
* Pan fry as normal pancakes


# Cookies

## Amaretti 
### Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups almond flour or very finely ground almonds, sifted
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* pinch salt
* 2 large egg whites
* 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* confectioners’ sugar, as needed

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Stack two matching, heavyweight, cookie sheets together. Line with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
* In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, sugar and salt until evenly incorporated.
* In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk egg whites and lemon juice until they hold soft peaks.
* Add beaten egg whites and almond extract to dry ingredients and stir until mixture forms a soft, sticky dough, kneading with your hands if necessary. No need to be gentle here, we’re not making macarons. ;)
* Lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar. Use a small cookie scoop to portion dough into 1-inch balls. Roll into a smooth ball, then roll in powdered sugar. Arrange on parchment or silicon-lined baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between cookies.
* Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until tops are cracked and bottoms are just barely golden (if you are NOT using doubled cookie sheets your cookies will brown much quicker, and will likely only need 25 minutes, so watch them closely). If you prefer crunchier cookies you can give them an extra 5 minutes or so or until the tops begin to brown too.
* Remove from oven; let cool a few minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Terminate distribuendo uniformemente sulla superficie l'uvetta scolata e strizzata, e poi i pinoli.

- Wash the potatoes, put them with their peel into a pot filled with cold water and boil for about 35 minutes or until tender.
- Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent.
- Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside.
- Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot.
- Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper.
- Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan.
- Sprinkle on the top some breadcrumbs and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden. Let it cool down and serve warm or cool (the day after they are even better!).
