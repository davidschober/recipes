## Buffalo Cauliflower

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Description

So yummy!

### Ingredients

Cauliflower:

* 1 large head cauliflower (about 2½ pounds), cut into medium and large florets (about 8 cups)
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* Can also add: Garlic powder and paprika

Buffalo Sauce:

* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* ⅓ cup Buffalo-style hot sauce (Frank's Original)

### Directions

* Heat oven to 400 degrees, and place a rack close to the broiler and another in the middle of the oven. (If your broiler is in a drawer below the oven, no need to move the racks.)
* In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with the oil to evenly coat, then season with salt and pepper. Spread out the cauliflower on a baking sheet in an even layer (arrange flat edges pan-side down for extra browning). Bake the cauliflower on the middle rack, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.
* As cauliflower roasts, make the sauce: Melt the butter with the hot sauce in a medium saucepan or skillet over low heat, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Once melted, turn off the heat, but keep the saucepan on the stove.
* Pull the cauliflower out of the oven, and turn on the broiler. Transfer the cauliflower to the hot sauce-butter mixture, stirring the cauliflower to fully coat with the sauce. Then, using a slotted spoon, transfer the cauliflower back to the baking sheet in an even layer.
* Broil until the cauliflower is singed in spots and cooked throughout, about 5 minutes. (Depending on your broiler, you may need to rotate the pan after 2 or 3 minutes for even cooking.) Serve with yogurt ranch for dipping or drizzling, if desired.

### Notes

From NYT Cooking.

(Stephanie): We added garlic powder and paprika to cauliflower before baking.

Serve with Dairy-free ranch (recipe on this site) or some other dipping sauce.

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 1 hour | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

* 500 g di farina di castagne

* 50 g di zucchero di canna biologico (facoltativo)  
* 150 g di uvetta  
* 20 g circa di pinoli italiani

### Directions

* Sciacquate l'uva passa, e lasciatela in ammollo circa 30 minuti in acqua tiepida. 
* In una terrina molto capiente versate tutta la farina di castagne setacciandola, in modo da non creare grumi. Aggiungete lo zucchero, un pizzico di sale fino e l'acqua a filo poco per volta, lavorando delicatamente con una frusta. Quando il composto diventerà omogeneo e morbido, coprite la terrina con un canovaccio e fate riposare tre ore.
* Aggiungete nel composto che si sarà addensato i semini di finocchietto, due cucchiai di olio e incorporate bene mescolando con un cucchiaio di legno. Ungete una teglia rettangolare (25 x 35) e antiaderente con l'olio rimasto, e versatevi la crema di farina di castagne ottenuta. Terminate distribuendo uniformemente sulla superficie l'uvetta scolata e strizzata, e poi i pinoli.
* Cuocete nel forno preriscaldato a 180°C per circa un’ora. Il castagnaccio è pronto quando si stacca dalle pareti della teglia e la parte superiore assume un bel colore dorato, con le caratteristiche crepe

* ½ cubetto di lievito di birra
* 250 g di acqua
* Olio extravergine di oliva ligure
* 2 cucchiaini di sale fino marino (15/20 gr)

* 10 acciughe sotto sale
* 2 cipolle dolci di media grandezza
* 2 cucchiai di olive taggiasche
* Capperi sotto sale
* Origano
* Olio extravergine di oliva ligure

Directions

* Mettere la farina in una terrina, aggiungere il sale fino e mescolare. Sciogliere, il lievito e il miele (che serve ad attivare il lievito) in una tazza con acqua tiepida, mescolando; versare sulla farina e impastare. Lavorare in modo da ottenere un composto omogeneo, molto morbido, leggermente appiccicoso. Trasferire la pasta nella teglia, unta precedentemente con 2/3 cucchiai di olio e lasciarla lievitare, in un luogo tiepido, al riparo da correnti, per 45 minuti circa.
* Preparare nel frattempo il condimento: cuocere dolcemente in olio extra vergine di oliva le cipolle tagliate sottili; quando iniziano ad appassire, unire i pomodori pelati e spezzettati, far cuocere fino a completa evaporazione dell'acqua, aggiungere eventualmente un pochino di sale. Dissalare e diliscare le acciughe, lavarle e asciugarle adagiandole su carta da cucina.
* Stendere la pasta aiutandosi con le mani leggermente unte, senza toglierla dalla teglia. Lasciarla di nuovo lievitare altri 45 minuti. Distribuire la salsa in maniera uniforme, aggiungere le acciughe, i capperi già sciacquati e asciutti, le olive e una spolverata di origano; cospargere di olio extravergine di oliva e infornare a 250° per circa 20/30 minuti, fino a che il bordo della pizza non sarà dorato.

Cipolle Ripiene

### Ingredients

* 3 medium size potatoes
* 4 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium size onions, minced
* 1lb medium size white onions
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 3 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon of marjoram leaves, minced
* 1 tablespoon of fresh Italian (flat) parsley, minced
* fine sea salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* 1 cup fine unflavoured bread crumbs

### Directions

* Wash the potatoes, put them with their peel into a pot filled with cold water and boil for about 35 minutes or until tender.
* Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent.
* Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside.
* Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot.
* Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper.
* Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan.

## Sweet and Spicy Pecans

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 20 min | Servings: 8 |

### Ingredients

* Cooking spray
* 2 cups pecans, pieces or halves
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Directions

* Gather the ingredients
* Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil with cooking spray.
* Spread the pecans on the baking sheet and toast them in the oven until dark and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Stir every 3 or 4 minutes.
* While the pecans are toasting, prepare the coating mixture. Microwave the butter in a large microwave-safe bowl until melted. Stir in the brown sugar, maple syrup, salt, cayenne, and cinnamon.
* Once the pecans are fragrant, remove them from the oven and pour the hot nuts into the coating mixture, reserving the baking sheet. Be careful as it might splutter and hiss. Stir until the nuts are evenly coated.
* Pour the nuts back onto the reserved baking sheet, spreading them out into an even layer.
* Bake for another 10 minutes, stirring after every 3 to 4 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the nuts from the oven and allow them to cool and crisp up on the baking sheet.
* Once cool, break the nuts apart or coarsely chop them.
* Use them in your favorite recipe or simply serve and enjoy!

### Notes

* Originally from: [https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158](https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158 "https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-spicy-candied-pecans-521158")
* If you are very sensitive to spices, you might want to reduce the cayenne. On the other hand, if you’re a pepper enthusiast, feel free to increase it. The amount as written gives the nuts a subtle but noticeable “kick."
* If you don't have a microwave, you can melt the butter in a saucepan on the stove. Remove it from the heat before adding and stirring in the brown sugar and spices.
* You can use other nuts in place of the pecans. Yet, pecans are preferred because their sweet taste goes perfectly with this slightly spicy, slightly savory preparation.
* Store the sweet and spicy pecans in an airtight container at room temperature. They will retain their flavor and stay good up to a week.

## Torta di Patate

* 1/2 c. Grated Parmesan
* 1/2 c. Bread crumbs
* 1/2 c. Milk

* Bake for 45 min. In a 375 degree oven 
* (another version says 350 for 25 min)

## Torta Verde

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 35-40 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

Dough:

* 3 cups flour
* 1 cup warm water
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 T salt

Inside:

* 2 big bunches Swiss chard chopped and steamed. Can substitute spinach
* 4 small-med zucchini, shredded
* 1/2 bag frozen or 2 cans artichokes chopped fine
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or Romano)
* Handful of rice

### Directions

Dough:

* Mix until smooth dough forms
* Flour surface to roll out dough; divide dough
* Roll out 2 sheets to fit pan top and bottom
  * Bottom sheet is larger than first and should cover the pan with some dough hanging over the sides
  * Top sheet is a little larger than pan
* Oil pan and add cornmeal then add bottom sheet and have some hang over
* Mix inside ingredients all together
* Add inside ingredients to pan, put top dough on and fold over bottom sheet edges with top sheet to form crust
* Make holes in the top to let air escape
* Top generously with olive oil
* Bake until golden brown 35/40 min. 350-400 degrees
* Other notes say 400 degrees, 45 minutes. 
* Shake the pan; torta shouldn't stick when it's done because of the cornmeal

### Notes

We have several recipes and notes for torta verde. The above recipe should be for one large rectangular pan. But it doesn't list oil in the insides - according to notes, there should be oil, like 3/4-1 cup olive oil.

The chard and artichokes should be chopped, then steamed. The zucchini should be shredded and used raw (I think). Water should be squeezed out of the veggies after steaming.

For the dough, start with a mound of flour with a hole in middle. Add salt, add oil. Start mixing with hands, adding water a little at a time. Use a dough scraper. Mix until smooth ball. Cover. Not sure how long to let sit.

- Remove dough and roll out into 2-2 1/2 inch ropes and join the ends together to form a tear drop shape. Place shaped drops on a clean tea towel.
- In a large pot of boiling water, add drops a few at a time (depending on the size of the pot) they will sink, so when they have resurfaced remove with a slotted spoon and place on the tea towel. Then move to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
- Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes or until golden.

# Cookies

## Amaretti

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 25-35 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups almond flour or very finely ground almonds, sifted
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* pinch salt
* 2 large egg whites
* 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* confectioners’ sugar, as needed

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Stack two matching, heavyweight, cookie sheets together. Line with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
* In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, sugar and salt until evenly incorporated.
* In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk egg whites and lemon juice until they hold soft peaks.
* Add beaten egg whites and almond extract to dry ingredients and stir until mixture forms a soft, sticky dough, kneading with your hands if necessary. No need to be gentle here, we’re not making macarons. ;)
* Lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar. Use a small cookie scoop to portion dough into 1-inch balls. Roll into a smooth ball, then roll in powdered sugar. Arrange on parchment or silicon-lined baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between cookies.
* Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until tops are cracked and bottoms are just barely golden (if you are NOT using doubled cookie sheets your cookies will brown much quicker, and will likely only need 25 minutes, so watch them closely). If you prefer crunchier cookies you can give them an extra 5 minutes or so or until the tops begin to brown too.
* Remove from oven; let cool a few minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Biscotti are hard Italian cookies, meant for dunking in coffee. The word biscotti means 'twice-cooked,' because the dough is baked first in logs, then cut and cooked again. 

Stored in an airtight container, these will keep for an extended time.

## Flourless Chocolate Cake

Prep Time:15 min | Cook Time : 25 min | Servings: 16 |

### Description

From Two Peas and Their Pod online blog

### Ingredients

**For the cake:**

* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 large eggs _slightly beaten_
* 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa powder

**For the chocolate ganache:**

* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease an 8-Inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Cut a piece of parchment to fit the bottom of the pan. Place it in the bottom of the pan and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
* To make the cake, put the chocolate and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft, about one minute. Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. If you need to reheat, do for 10 seconds at a time and stir.
* Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract and stir to combine.
* Add the eggs and stir until smooth. Add the cocoa powder and stir until just combined. Don’t over mix.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the cake for 25 minutes or until the cake has a thin crust on the top and the center registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.
* Let the cake cool on a wire cooling rack for 10 minutes. Loosen the edges of the pan with a butter knife and carefully turn it upside down onto a cake plate or serving plate. The bottom of the cake will now be the top of the cake. Let the cake cool completely.
* While the cake is cooling, make the chocolate ganache. Combine the chocolate and cream in a medium microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the cream is very hot so it will melt the chocolate. I always start with 30 seconds and check it. It might take longer, it just depends on your microwave. Remove from the microwave, and stir until the the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.
* Spread the chocolate ganache glaze evenly over the cooled cake. Let the glaze set up for a few hours before cutting and serving the cake. I always put it in the refrigerator to speed up the process.
* Cut the cake into slices and serve with powdered sugar and raspberries, if desired. This cake is also great with whipped cream or ice cream.

### Notes

From Two Peas and Their Pod: [https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/ "https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/")

* Bake the cake in an **8-inch round cake pan**. Make sure you grease the pan with nonstick cooking AND line it with **parchment paper**. I also grease the parchment paper after it goes in the pan. You don’t want the cake to stick.
* Make sure you use the best chocolate for the recipe so you get the best chocolate flavor. You can use chocolate chips or chopped up chocolate.
* I use semi-sweet chocolate but if you like darker chocolate, bittersweet would work well too.
* I use **Dutch process cocoa** because it gives the cake a deep, chocolate flavor.
* I melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave, but you can melt it on low in a pan using the stove top.
* Don’t over bake the cake. You want it to be nice and fudgy. It is done when the center reads 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.
* Let the cake cool completely before adding the chocolate ganache glaze.
* After the cake is glazed, let the glaze set up before cutting. I like to put it in the refrigerator for a few hours so the glaze can set up.
* Serve the cake with a dusting of powdered sugar and fresh raspberries. We also like to serve whipped cream or ice cream on the side balance out the rich chocolate cake

## Flourless Chocolate Cake - Rosa

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : 45 min | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

* ½ cup water
* ¼ tsp sea salt
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* 18 oz (2 ¼ cups) bittersweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)*
* 1 cup salted butter, room temperature or Earth’s Balance
* 6 eggs, room temperature
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Grease one 9” round cake pan (or glass pie plate) and set aside. (Note: I always cut a piece of parchment paper into a circle with “handles” and place it on the bottom of the pan. Then I grease the pan with the parchment paper in it).
* In a small saucepan over medium heat combine the water, salt and sugar. Whisk every 60 seconds until completely dissolved and set aside.
* Melt the chocolate chips (in the microwave or in a double boiler) and pour into the bowl of a standing mixer.
* Cut the butter into 1 TBS pieces and beat it into the chocolate, 1 piece at a time.
* Mix in the warm sugar/water mixture until combined.
* Slowly beat in the eggs, one at a time until completely smooth.
* Add vanilla and mix until just combined.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
* Put the cake pan in a larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water until it reaches halfway up the sides of your cake pan. Be very careful not to get water into the cake! I like to put the pan with the cake in it on the oven rack before pouring the water. That way I just have to slide it in and close the door!
* Bake cake in the water bath at 300 degrees F for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet, but the edge will look done.
* Remove the cake from the water bath and let it cool on a wire rack.
* Chill cake overnight (or for at least 6 hours) in the pan!
* Carefully lift the parchment paper out of the pan and the cake with it. Put it on a serving plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar! Serve with fresh berries, ice cream, etc!

# Main Dishes

## Chicken Piccata

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

* 2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4
* 2 tablespoons flour (all purpose or plain)
* 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Cracked pepper

**For The Sauce:**

* Light spray of cooking oil
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 teaspoons butter (or oil)
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 1 1/4 cup chicken broth (stock)
* 1/2 cup milk (full fat or 2% -- or use reduced fat cream or heavy cream)
* 1/2 cup finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons capers (plus 2 tablespoons extra to garnish)
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with 1 tablespoon of water
* 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice -- juice of 1 lemon (adjust to your tastes)
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley

### Directions

* Lightly spray pan/skillet with a light coating of cooking oil spray and heat over medium-hight heat. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and parmesan cheese. Season the chicken with salt and pepper; dredge in the flour mixture; shake off excess and set aside.
* Heat the 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 teaspoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until butter has melted and pan is hot. Fry the chicken until golden on each side and cooked through and no longer pink (about 3-4 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer onto a warm plate.
* Add the garlic to the oil in the pan (spray with a light coating of oil if needed) and fry until fragrant (about 1 minute). Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the broth and milk (or cream). Bring the sauce to a boil; season with salt and pepper to your taste; add in the parmesan cheese and capers and allow sauce to simmer for about 2 minutes until thicker. (If the sauce is too runny for your liking, add the cornstarch/water mixture into the centre of the pan and mix through fast to combine into the sauce. It will begin to thicken immediately).
* Pour in the lemon juice, allow to simmer for a further minute to combine. Add the chicken back into the pan to serve, or serve over steamed vegetables, zucchini noodles or cooked pasta with the sauce. Top with extra capers to garnish, lemon slices and parsley.

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

- Flour one handful per person
- Water 

### Directions

- None provided

## Ravioli

Prep Time:- | Cook Time : - | Servings: - |

### Ingredients

DOUGH

* 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 large eggs, plus 1 for egg wash
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Cornmeal, for dusting

Gluten-free:

* substitute gluten-free all-purpose flour
* add 2 tsp per cup of flour of Xantham gum (if not already in the flour you are using)
* 1 additional egg

FILLING

Spinach and Ricotta Filling

* 1 lb chopped spinach
  * Use frozen, microwave until thawed and squeeze all liquid out; almost dry
* 1 lb ricotta
* 1 egg
* 1/2 c. grated cheese
* Salt, pepper
* Dash of nutmeg

Mushroom filling

* Mixed mushrooms - baby bellas, shitake, chanterelles, etc. (whatever is available, but not white). Diced.
* Garlic, diced
* Salt
* Fresh sage, chopped

### Directions

Filling:

Spinach/Ricotta: Mix all ingredients

Mushroom filling:

* Saute garlic in oil
* Add mushrooms, cook down on med/high heat. Liquid should boil off, but you may need to spoon out
* Add salt as you go
* Chopped sage at the end for a few minutes

Dough/Ravioli Assembly

Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed.

Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. 

Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they'll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve.

### Notes

Stephanie's notes: We didn't use cornmeal, just floured surface. Freezing during prep helps dry out the ravioli and keeps them from sticking to each other.

We put the ravioli in the water in batches. Remove with slotted spoon into serving dish, adding sauce in layers.
