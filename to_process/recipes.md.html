## Dad’s Sauce

**Ingredients**

- 1 large onion chopped and sautéed until translucent
- Olive oil (quello buono)
- 1 Large can of crushed tomatoes
- 1 Pomì of strained tomatoes
- Salt, pepper to taste
- Rosemary (fresh if possible)
 
**Directions**

Cover the bottom of the pan with oil on medium heat
When oil is beginning to sizzle add the onion and rosemary. Stir so onion and rosemary don’t burn.
Add tomatoes salt and pepper.
Bring everything to a boil and then lower heat and simmer for 40/45 minutes and voilà
Keep the can to add water to the sauce as needed.
My mom always added butter at the end to giver it a more velvety taste. I haven’t done it but it’s an option
Obviously medium heat and simmer is not the same for all stoves so you have to play with it
