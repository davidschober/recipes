Spread out the cauliflower on a baking sheet in an even layer (arrange flat edges pan-side down for extra browning). Bake the cauliflower on the middle rack, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.\n* As cauliflower roasts, make the sauce: Melt the butter with the hot sauce in a medium saucepan or skillet over low heat, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Once melted, turn off the heat, but keep the saucepan on the stove.\n* Pull the cauliflower out of the oven, and turn on the broiler.
