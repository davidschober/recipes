Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds, then stir in the lemon juice and zest.\n* Place the cod fillets in the pan and cook for 1 minute, then carefully turn them over.\n* Place the skillet in the oven about 4-6 inches from the broiler. Broil for 6-9 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fillets, or until the internal temperature of the cod reaches 130-140°F on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the thickest portion of a fillet.\n* Garnish with the parsley and extra lemon slices, if desired, and serve.\n\n### Notes \n\nTaken from: [https://deliciouslittlebites.com/broiled-cod/](https://deliciouslittlebites.com/broiled-cod/ \"https://deliciouslittlebites.com/broiled-cod/\")\n\n\n","servings":"3-4","slug":"broiled-cod-with-lemon-garlic-butter-sauce","tags":[],"title":"Broiled Cod with Lemon Garlic Butter Sauce"},{"categories":["Cookies","Desserts"],"contents":"Description https://www.barleyandsage.com/brown-butter-sugar-cookies/\nIngredients  1 cup unsalted brown butter, room temperature 1 ¼ cup granulated sugar ¼ cup light brown sugar 2 large eggs, room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract ½ teaspoon almond extract, optional ½ teaspoon lemon juice, optional 2 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda ½ teaspoon kosher salt sparkling sugar, for topping  Directions  Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the brown butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and lemon juice and beat for 3-4 minutes until the texture is light and fluffy (it should look much paler than before). Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined. The dough should be wet and sticky. Spoon a generous 3 tablespoons of dough and roll into balls.

Stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened. Add the squash and sweet potato and stir to combine. Add a pinch of salt and continue sautéing for a few minutes longer. Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with juices), coconut milk, lentils, tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. (If you are spice-shy, feel free to add half the amount to start and increase from there after cooking, to taste.) Stir well to combine. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir again, and simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potato are fork-tender. Reduce the heat if necessary. Add the apple cider vinegar to taste. Adjust the other seasonings if desired. Optional step: Using a handheld immersion blender, blend the stew for only 2 to 3 seconds (any more and you’ll blend too much of the veggies). This thickens the broth. Stir in the chard, and cook for another couple minutes until the greens are wilted. Scoop some cooked rice onto the bottom of a bowl and then ladle the stew overtop. Garnish with minced cilantro or parsley and a good dusting of garlic and chili powder, if desired. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days, and they freeze beautifully too.  Notes * Make sure to dice the squash and potato very small (about the size of almonds), as this will expedite cooking. Also, if you are short on time, you can skip peeling the butternut squash as the skin is edible.

Grease an 8-Inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Cut a piece of parchment to fit the bottom of the pan. Place it in the bottom of the pan and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. To make the cake, put the chocolate and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft, about one minute. Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. If you need to reheat, do for 10 seconds at a time and stir. Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Add the eggs and stir until smooth. Add the cocoa powder and stir until just combined. Don’t over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the cake for 25 minutes or until the cake has a thin crust on the top and the center registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.

Notes From Two Peas and Their Pod: https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/\n Bake the cake in an 8-inch round cake pan. Make sure you grease the pan with nonstick cooking AND line it with parchment paper. I also grease the parchment paper after it goes in the pan. You don’t want the cake to stick. Make sure you use the best chocolate for the recipe so you get the best chocolate flavor. You can use chocolate chips or chopped up chocolate. I use semi-sweet chocolate but if you like darker chocolate, bittersweet would work well too. I use Dutch process cocoa because it gives the cake a deep, chocolate flavor. I melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave, but you can melt it on low in a pan using the stove top. Don’t over bake the cake. You want it to be nice and fudgy. It is done when the center reads 200°F on an instant-read thermometer. Let the cake cool completely before adding the chocolate ganache glaze. After the cake is glazed, let the glaze set up before cutting. I like to put it in the refrigerator for a few hours so the glaze can set up.

Rinse the fish and pat very dry with paper towels. Put the flour and beaten egg into 2 separate bowls and season each with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dust the fish with flour, tapping off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg. Dust the fish with flour, once again, tapping off any excess.\nCook the Fish In a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the fish and cook without disturbing until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. Transfer the fish to a platter. Pour off the oil and wipe out the skillet.\nMake the Pan Sauce and Serve Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, the garlic, and capers to the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and lightly browned, about 2 minutes.

Rinse the fish and pat very dry with paper towels. Put the flour and beaten egg into 2 separate bowls and season each with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dust the fish with flour, tapping off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg. Dust the fish with flour, once again, tapping off any excess.\n\nCook the Fish In a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the fish and cook without disturbing until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. Transfer the fish to a platter. Pour off the oil and wipe out the skillet.\n\n#### Make the Pan Sauce and Serve\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of the butter, the garlic, and capers to the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and ¼ cup water. Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and cook, shaking and swirling the pan occasionally until the sauce is emulsified. Stir in the lemon zest, then season with salt and pepper.

Using wooden spoon or hands, mix well, but do not overwork.\n\n###### **Step 5**\n\nIn heavy-bottomed, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter until hot but not smoking. Drop 4 scant ¼-cup portions of potato mixture into pan and flatten with spatula to form four 3-inch pancakes.\n\n###### **Step 6**\n\nFry until bottoms are golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then turn over and fry until golden-brown and crisp, an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season immediately with salt and pepper. Keep warm on baking sheets in oven while making remaining pancakes.\n\n###### **Step 7**\n\nUsing paper towels, carefully wipe out pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter and fry 4 more pancakes. Repeat with remaining batter, wiping out pan and adding 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter before each batch.\n\n###### **Step 8**\n\nServe pancakes hot with applesauce and/or sour cream.\n\n### Notes \n\nUse gluten-free flour if needed. We added baking powder to the recipe.\n\nFrom Epicurious: [https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-potato-pancakes-233361](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-potato-pancakes-233361 \"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-potato-pancakes-233361\")\n\n\n","servings":"24 pancakes","slug":"potato-pancakes","tags":["Holiday"],"title":"Potato Pancakes"},{"categories":["Breads"],"contents":"Description Easter babies\nIngredients  1c.

Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.) Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating. Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or easy cookie icing. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting. Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days.  Notes Recipe: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-sugar-cookies/ Notes from original recipe\n Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes – 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking. Room Temperature: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it’s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough. Flavors: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.

Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent. Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside. Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot. Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan.
