Stack two matching, heavyweight, cookie sheets together. Line with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, sugar and salt until evenly incorporated.

No need to be gentle here, we’re not making macarons. ;) Lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar. Use a small cookie scoop to portion dough into 1-inch balls. Roll into a smooth ball, then roll in powdered sugar. Arrange on parchment or silicon-lined baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between cookies. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until tops are cracked and bottoms are just barely golden (if you are NOT using doubled cookie sheets your cookies will brown much quicker, and will likely only need 25 minutes, so watch them closely). If you prefer crunchier cookies you can give them an extra 5 minutes or so or until the tops begin to brown too.

Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside. Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot. Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan. Sprinkle on the top some breadcrumbs and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden. Let it cool down and serve warm or cool (the day after they are even better!).
