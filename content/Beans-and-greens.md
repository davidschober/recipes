title: Braised White Beans and Greens with Parmesan (Beans and Greens)
---

## Description 

Beans and Greens. Serve with bread. 

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 small fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, small-diced (we dont' use this)
* 1 small yellow onion, small-diced
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary or thyme
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
* 1 large or 2 small bunches escarole, kale, or swiss chard, stems removed (10-12 ounces). We use chard.
* 2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed
* 2 cups veg or chicken broth
* kosher salt and pepper
* 1 T lemon juice
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella (optional)
* 3 T grated parmesan or pecorino, plus more for serving
* Toasted country bread, for serving

## Directions

1. In a 12-inch skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium. Add the fennel, onion and rosemary, and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add the garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Begin adding handfuls of the greens, cooking and stirring until leaves wilt.
3. Add the white beans, broth and Â¼ teaspoon black pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer, mashing some of the beans with a wooden spoon, until the liquid has reduced and thickened, 6 to 8 minutes.
4. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice, then the mozzarella, if using, and Pecorino Romano. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Divide among shallow bowls and top with more Pecorino Romano. Serve with toasted bread and a dish of red-pepper flakes on the side.

## Notes 

Sometimes we add white wine before the broth.
Good as a main with sausage or a side. Good as leftovers.
