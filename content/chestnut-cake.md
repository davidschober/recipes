Fold the whites into the chestnut mixture.\n* Turn the batter into the prepared pan.\n* Bake 35-40 minutes, or until the cake is firm and cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan and let cool completely.\n* Meanwhile, in a double boiler or microwave, melt the chocolate with the remaining 2 T butter, stirring frequently until smooth.\n* Invert the cake onto a platter. Remove the base of the pan and peel off the parchment. Pour the chocolate glaze over the cake and spread evenly over the top and sides.\n* Note: to toast pine nuts, cook in small ungreased skillet over moderately high heat, tossing frequently until lightly browned, about 2 minutes."
