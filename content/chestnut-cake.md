* 1 lb. roasted chestnuts (2 cups)
* 1/2 c. pine nuts, toasted
* 1 c. sugar
* 4 eggs separated
* 10 T. butter, room temperature
* 1 t. vanilla
* 4 ounces semisweet chocolate"""
directions = """
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment or waxed paper. Butter the paper and flour the pan.
* In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture is pale and thick enough to leave a ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in 8 tablespoons of the butter and the vanilla.
* Grate the pine nuts and chestnuts. Stir into egg mixture.
* In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold the whites into the chestnut mixture.
* Turn the batter into the prepared pan.
* Bake 35-40 minutes, or until the cake is firm and cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan and let cool completely.
* Meanwhile, in a double boiler or microwave, melt the chocolate with the remaining 2 T butter, stirring frequently until smooth.
* Invert the cake onto a platter. Remove the base of the pan and peel off the parchment. Pour the chocolate glaze over the cake and spread evenly over the top and sides.
* Note: to toast pine nuts, cook in small ungreased skillet over moderately high heat, tossing frequently until lightly browned, about 2 minutes."""
