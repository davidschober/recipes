directions = "* First, cook the lentils according to the instructions on the package. Then put about 6 tablespoons of the cooked lentils aside. You'll need them later on to give the lentil loaf a bit more texture. \n* Sauté the onion and garlic for about 2 minutes. Then add the chopped carrots and cook them for another 3 minutes. \n* Put all ingredients except the spices into a blender or food processor and blend until you have a sticky but chunky mixture. It's very important that you make sure to not overdo it, so you still got some texture.\n* Add the remaining lentils and season with thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, and fresh parsley.\n* Place the mixture into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Make sure to let the parchment paper overlap the loaf pan, so it's easier to remove the lentil loaf once it's done. \n* Bake for 60 minutes at 350°F. \n* Let the lentil loaf cool down for a bit in the loaf pan before serving it.
