* First, cook the lentils according to the instructions on the package. Then put about 6 tablespoons of the cooked lentils aside. You'll need them later on to give the lentil loaf a bit more texture. 
* Sauté the onion and garlic for about 2 minutes. Then add the chopped carrots and cook them for another 3 minutes. 
* Put all ingredients except the spices into a blender or food processor and blend until you have a sticky but chunky mixture. It's very important that you make sure to not overdo it, so you still got some texture.
* Add the remaining lentils and season with thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, and fresh parsley.
* Place the mixture into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Make sure to let the parchment paper overlap the loaf pan, so it's easier to remove the lentil loaf once it's done. 
* Bake for 60 minutes at 350°F. 
* Let the lentil loaf cool down for a bit in the loaf pan before serving it. """

notes = """
* Recipe recommends making the lentil loaf the night before and reheating it on the next day (at 350°F for about 20 minutes). This way it will be much firmer.
* Properly stored it will keep up to 5 days in the fridge and 8 weeks in the freezer.
