## Description

Rosa’s notes: This recipe comes from Adriana Scalora a former student of mine at LTHS (1979-2003). I’ve made them for Christmas ever since she gave me the recipe in the late 80s.

## Ingredients

* 1/4  c. honey				
* 1 ½ c. sugar
* 1 lb. Skinless slivered almonds, toasted
* 2 T. sesame seeds, toasted
* 1  t.	 diced orange peel

## Directions

* Bring honey to a boil
* Add sugar and stir until dissolved
* Add orange peel and almonds and cook stirring for 2-3 min.
* Pour mixture onto a cold wet marble surface or a cutting board (have a glass of cold water near to wet the marble and to dip the knife into it)
* Use a knife to form the mixture into an oval shape and to flatten
* Cut into bite size pieces while still warm
* Transfer pieces to a glass plate (they will be sticky)
