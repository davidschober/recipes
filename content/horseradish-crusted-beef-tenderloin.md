title: Horseradish-Crusted Beef Tenderloin
---

## Description 
From Epicurious: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/horseradish-crusted-beef-tenderloin-232147

## Ingredients

* 1 (3 1/2-lb) trimmed center-cut beef tenderloin roast, tied
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 lb fresh horseradish, peeled and coarsely grated (1 cup; see cooks' note, below)
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

## Directions

Step 1
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.

Step 2
Pat tenderloin dry, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Step 3
Straddle a 17- by 12-inch flameproof heavy roasting pan across 2 burners and heat 3 tablespoons oil in pan over high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown tenderloin on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Remove from heat and transfer meat to a cutting board to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Put a lightly oiled metal rack inside roasting pan.

Step 4
While meat cools, toss horseradish with remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Rub meat all over with mustard, then transfer to rack in roasting pan and coat top and sides of meat with horseradish, pressing to help adhere.

Step 5
Roast tenderloin until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of meat registers 120°F, 25 to 35 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to cutting board and cool, uncovered, to room temperature, about 45 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to at least 130°F before cooling.)

Step 6
Remove and discard string. Cut tenderloin into thick slices.




## Notes 
If fresh horseradish is unavailable, substitute 3/4 cup drained bottled white horseradish. Rinse well in a sieve, then squeeze very dry in 3 or 4 layers of paper towels.
