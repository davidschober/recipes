## Ingredients 

* 1 cup shortening
* 1 cup peanut butter
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 cup granulated sugar, plus Â½ cup for rolling the cookies
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 (9 ounce) bags milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped

## Directions 

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
* In a large bowl, cream together shortening, peanut butter, brown sugar, and 1 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Add in the eggs one at a time, beating until fully incorporated. Mix in milk and vanilla.
* In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to the peanut butter mixture until well blended.
* Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into balls, and roll in remaining granulated sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
* Bake in preheated oven for 10 to12 minutes. Remove from oven, and immediately press a chocolate kiss into each cookie. Allow to cool completely; the kiss will harden as it cools.
* Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
