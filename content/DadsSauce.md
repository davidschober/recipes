## Notes

* this is a list
* this is another list

## Ingredients

* 1 large onion chopped and sautéed until translucent
* Olive oil (quello buono)
* 1  Large can of crushed tomatoes
* 1 Pomì of strained tomatoes
* Salt, pepper to taste
*  Rosemary (fresh if possible)

## Directions

    ⁃	Cover the bottom of the pan with oil on medium heat
    ⁃	When oil is beginning to sizzle add the onion and rosemary. 
    ⁃	Stir so onion and rosemary don’t burn.
    ⁃	Add tomatoes salt and pepper.
    ⁃	Bring everything to a boil and then lower heat and simmer for 40/45 minutes and voilà
    ⁃	Keep the can to add water to the sauce as needed.
    ⁃	My mom always added butter at the end to giver it a more velvety taste. I haven’t done it but it’s an option
    ⁃	Obviously medium heat and simmer is not the same for all stoves so you have to play with it
