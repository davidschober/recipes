  * Cover the bottom of the pan with oil on medium heat

  * When oil is beginning to sizzle add the onion and rosemary.

  * Stir so onion and rosemary don’t burn.

  * Add tomatoes salt and pepper.

  * Bring everything to a boil and then lower heat and simmer for 40/45 minutes
  and voilà

  * Keep the can to add water to the sauce as needed.

  * Obviously medium heat and simmer is not the same for all stoves so you have
  to play with it
ingredients: |-

  * Olive oil (quello buono)

notes: >-
  My mom always added butter at the end to give it a more velvety taste. I
  haven’t done it but it’s an option
