1. Whisk eggs with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil until frothy. Set aside.
2. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Add mixed vegetables to wok and cook, stirring constantly, until cooked al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Add prawns and cook (still stirring constantly) until heated through, about 2 minutes.
5. Before opening the package of Riced Broccoli, bang the bag on the counter a few times to break up any large clumps. Add the frozen riced broccoli and salt to the wok. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
6. Make a large space in the bottom of the wok by pushing the prawns and veggies up the side. Pour the eggs into the space and let set.
7. Mix the eggs into the rest of the ingredients. Add remaining 2 teaspoons of sesame oil and coconut aminos and stir to incorporate.
8. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with sliced spring onions and sesame seeds. (optional)"""

Stephanie and David: We use riced cauliflower and frozen veggies. Our shrimp is usually frozen so we cook it separately and then mix in.
