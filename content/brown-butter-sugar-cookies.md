## Description 
https://www.barleyandsage.com/brown-butter-sugar-cookies/

## Ingredients

* 1 cup unsalted brown butter, room temperature
* 1 ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon almond extract, optional
* ½ teaspoon lemon juice, optional
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* sparkling sugar, for topping

## Directions

1. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the brown butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and lemon juice and beat for 3-4 minutes until the texture is light and fluffy (it should look much paler than before).
2. Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined. The dough should be wet and sticky.
3. Spoon a generous 3 tablespoons of dough and roll into balls. If desired, roll the tops in sparkling sugar.
4. Cover the dough and chill in the fridge overnight (minimum of 2 hours if you just can't wait).
5. Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a light colored baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Place dough balls at least 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheet (they will spread, I usually only do 6 cookies on a half sheet pan). Place the rest of the cookie dough balls back in the fridge while the first batch cooks.
7. Bake cookies for on the center rack of the oven for 9-11 minute or until the edges are set and the centers are still soft.
8. Remove from the oven and let rest on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.

## Notes 

To make brown butter, melt unsalted butter over medium heat, stirring frequently. Watch closely for the butter to develop brown specs and a nutty aroma. Once you start seeing brown specs, let cook for just a few seconds longer (watch very carefully or it will burn). Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl so that it doesn't continue to cook. Set aside and let cool for about 20 minutes in the fridge until soft and pliable. Note: For every ½ cup (1 stick or 113g), you'll lose about 1 tablespoon (14g) to evaporation while cooking. So you can either add in an extra 1 tablespoon before browning, or if you're browning big batches, just make up the weight difference in your recipe with regular unsalted butter if needed.

Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week (they'll definitely be gone before then though).

The dough will keep in the fridge for up to a week (which is great for just making a couple of warm cookies at a time) just make sure to transfer to an airtight container so it doesn't dry out.

Freeze pre-rolled cookie dough balls in the freezer for up to 6 months.
