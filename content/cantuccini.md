## Description 

Biscotti

## Ingredients 

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour sifted
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 2 Tbs butter, room temp
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 4 eggs
* 1 cup raw unpeeled almonds

## Directions 

* Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F
* In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients.
* Add butter
* Add the eggs, mix all the ingredients.
* Once you have a crumbly, soft mixture, add the almonds.
* Transfer the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it into 2-3 logs that are approximately 30 cm (12 inch) long, and 5 cm (2 inch) wide.
* Wet your hands, it will be easier to shape the dough.
* Place the logs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or with a silicone mat.
* Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown.
* Remove the logs from the oven and let them cool for about 10 minutes before slicing.
* Place a log on a cutting board and using a sharp, serrated knife, cut it diagonally into 1.5 cm (1/2 inch) slices.
* Put the cookies back on the baking sheet and bake them for 10-15 minutes.
* Remove the cantuccini from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
* Store them in a sealed container for several weeks.
