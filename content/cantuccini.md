directions = "* Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F\n* In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients.\n* Add butter\n* Add the eggs, mix all the ingredients.\n* Once you have a crumbly, soft mixture, add the almonds.\n* Transfer the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it into 2-3 logs that are approximately 30 cm (12 inch) long, and 5 cm (2 inch) wide.\n* Wet your hands, it will be easier to shape the dough.\n* Place the logs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or with a silicone mat.\n* Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown.\n* Remove the logs from the oven and let them cool for about 10 minutes before slicing.\n* Place a log on a cutting board and using a sharp, serrated knife, cut it diagonally into 1.5 cm (1/2 inch) slices.\n* Put the cookies back on the baking sheet and bake them for 10-15 minutes.\n* Remove the cantuccini from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.\n* Store them in a sealed container for several weeks."
