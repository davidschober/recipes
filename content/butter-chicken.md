title: Butter Chicken

---

## Description 

Quick 20-minute butter chicken is creamy and packed full of flavor. It's simplified and cooked all in one pan and goes great with a side of rice or naan! 

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, finely minced or grated (or use paste)
* 2-3 cloves garlic, finely minced or crushed
* 1 ½ pounds about 2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into ¾-inch chunks
* 4 tablespoons tomato paste, or 8 oz can of tomato sauce
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon chili powder, or paprika, adjust to taste
* 1 teaspoon Fenugreek, I use powder, but seeds or mustard seeds can be used too, optional*
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1 cup heavy cream, sub for half & half or yogurt for low fat
* Hot cooked rice, quinoa, and/or naan for serving

## Directions

1. Heat a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oil, butter, and onions and cook onions down until lightly golden, about 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and let cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn.
2. Add the chicken, tomato paste, and spices. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until everything is cooked through.
3. Add the heavy cream and simmer for 8-10 minutes stirring occasionally. Serve over Basmati rice or with naan.

## Notes 
Add peas. We use yogurt (mixed with a little water for consistency). Could also use coconut milk.
