directions = "1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a stock pot (or a very large, deep sauté pan) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sausage and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is lightly browned. Transfer to a clean plate and set aside.\n2. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the stock pot. Add bell peppers, celery, jalapeño, onion and garlic. Sauté for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.\n3. Add the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, rice, Cajun seasoning, thyme, cayenne, bay leaf, and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer. Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is nearly cooked through, stirring every 5 minutes or so along the way so that the rice does not burn.\n4. Add the shrimp, okra, and stir to combine. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through and pink. Stir in the chicken and sausage, and remove and discard the bay leaf.\n5. Taste season the jambalaya with salt, pepper, and additional Cajun seasoning if needed. (I typically add about 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.) Remove from heat.\n6. Serve warm with your desired garnishes. Or refrigerate and store in a sealed container for up to 3 days."

notes = "[https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/jambalaya-recipe/](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/jambalaya-recipe/ \"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/jambalaya-recipe/\")\n\nFrom recipe: *Feel free to use fresh or frozen okra. If using frozen, make sure to thaw it before adding to the jambalaya.\n\nIf you like spicy jambalaya, I would recommend adding in 2 jalapeños. If you would like it more mild, you can omit the jalapeño altogether.\n\nStephanie and David notes:\n\n* We halved this recipe and had leftovers\n* We used brown rice, vegetable stock, and no meat\n* We did not use okra, celery, or jalapeno\n* We used beyond meat Italian sausage\n* We cooked the shrimp separately with some salt; I would also add some of the seasoning\n* The Creole seasoning is really good! I halved it the first time we made it and only used a portion for the jambalaya"
