directions = "* Preheat the broiler on the oven. Pat the cod with a paper towel, then season both sides with the salt and pepper.\n* Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a cast iron or oven-proof skillet that is no bigger than 12 inches. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds, then stir in the lemon juice and zest.\n* Place the cod fillets in the pan and cook for 1 minute, then carefully turn them over.\n* Place the skillet in the oven about 4-6 inches from the broiler. Broil for 6-9 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fillets, or until the internal temperature of the cod reaches 130-140Â°F on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the thickest portion of a fillet.\n* Garnish with the parsley and extra lemon slices, if desired, and serve."
