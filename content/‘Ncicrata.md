## Ingredients
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons oil I used canola
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons grappa limoncello or rum are also good choices
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 1/4 cups allpurpose flour approximately
- vegetable oil for deep frying

## Directions
- In a medium sized bowl whisk together the eggs, sugar, oil, vanilla extract, grappa and milk.
- Stir in the salt, baking powder, 3 cups of the flour and the remaining 1/4 cup of flour only as much as you need to achieve a soft malleable dough.
- Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and with floured hands knead lightly for a minute.
- Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest for a 1/2 hour.
- Cut off small pieces of dough at a time and roll out into 1/2 inch thick ropes. If the dough feels sticky, dust your hands lightly with flour.
