## Ingredients 

#### Black Bean Chili Filling:

* 1 tablespoon **olive oil**
* 1 **onion**, chopped
* 1 clove **garlic**, minced
* 1 **bell pepper**, chopped
* 1 medium **zucchini,** chopped
* 1 tablespoon **chili powder**
* 1/4 teaspoon **cayenne pepper** (use more if you want more heat)
* 1 teaspoon **ground cumin**
* 1 teaspoon **ground coriander**
* 1 15. oz. can **black beans**, drained and rinsed
* 1 15 oz. **diced tomatoes** with juice

#### Vegan Cornmeal Topping:

* 3/4 cup ground cornmeal
* 1/4 cup cup whole-wheat flour (use gluten-free flour blend for gluten free option)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 cup canola oil or olive oil
* 1 tablespoon maple syrup
* 3/4 cup unsweetened soymilk or other unsweetened non-dairy milk
* 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 4oz. can diced green chilis
* 1/2 cup corn (thawed from frozen or canned)

## Directions 

1. **Make the black bean chili layer.** Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and saut√© the onion for 5-6 minutes until translucent. Add a pinch of salt and the garlic, then stir together.
2. **Add the rest of the vegetables:** bell pepper and zucchini along with the chili powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, and coriander. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the beans and tomatoes with juice to the skillet.
3. **Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.**
4. **Make the cornbread filling.** Whisk together the dry ingredients: cornmeal, flour, baking powder in a large bowl. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the wet ingredients: oil, maple syrup, soymilk and apple cider vinegar.
5. Add the wet to the dry and mix until combined. Add in the green chilis and corn, mix again. You can also add shredded cheese, about 1/2 cup.
6. Pour the cornmeal batter over the filling and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.

## Notes 

For a cheesy cornbread topping, stir in shredded cheddar cheese (either regular or dairy-free) to the cornbread mixture.

We used cast iron skillet
