title = "Stuffed Onions"
description = "Cipolle Ripiene"
ingredients = "* 3 medium size potatoes\n* 4 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil\n* 1 medium size onions, minced\n* 1lb medium size white onions\n* 2 eggs, lightly beaten\n* 3 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese\n* 1 teaspoon of marjoram leaves, minced\n* 1 tablespoon of fresh Italian (flat) parsley, minced\n* fine sea salt to taste\n* pepper to taste\n* 1 cup fine unflavoured bread crumbs"
directions = "* Wash the potatoes, put them with their peel into a pot filled with cold water and boil for about 35 minutes or until tender.\n* Put the minced onion in a skillet with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin oil and let golden at low fire for about 15 minutes or until translucent.\n* Peel the other onions and boil them as a whole in salty water for about 10 minutes (they must remain firm), drain, cut them in halves longwise and gently tear off the layers so to obtain many little bowls. Chose the nicer and intact one. Chop the remaining part and set aside.\n* Add the onion pulp in the skillet with the minced onion and let fry for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, peel them and mash still hot.\n* Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the onion frying in the skillet, the eggs, the parmesan cheese, the mortadella, the marjoram leaves and the parsley. Stir, taste and season with salt and pepper.\n* Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover a baking pan with baking paper and pour some olive oil to grease. Fill the onions small bowls with the potatoes filling (you can use a sac-a-poche to help you or a teaspoon) and put them side by side in the pan.\n* Sprinkle on the top some breadcrumbs and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden. Let it cool down and serve warm or cool (the day after they are even better!)."
