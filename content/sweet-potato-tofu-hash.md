title: Sweet Potato Hash with Tofu
---

## Description 

This is a short description

## Ingredients

* 1 red bell pepper, cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 medium red onion, a quarter thinly sliced, the rest cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 rosemary sprig (optional)
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt
* 1 (14- to 16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu, cut into ½-inch pieces and patted very dry
* 8 ounces sweet potato (1 small), cut into ½-inch pieces
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2¼ teaspoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lime juice
* Fried or poached eggs, cilantro, parsley, hot sauce, Cheddar, feta and/or ketchup, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven, heat to 425 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment. 
2. In a medium bowl, toss the bell pepper, ½-inch pieces of red onion and the rosemary, if using, with 2 tablespoons oil. Season with a pinch of salt, then arrange in a single layer on about one-quarter of the prepared sheet pan.
3. In the same bowl, combine the tofu, sweet potato, cornstarch and 2 teaspoons chili powder and season generously with about 2 teaspoons salt. Toss gently until well coated, then add remaining 2 tablespoons oil and toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer next to the peppers and onion. Roast on the bottom rack until the vegetables are tender and the tofu is crisp underneath, 30 to 35 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, toss the sliced onion with the vinegar, remaining ¼ teaspoon chili powder and a pinch of salt. Serve the hash topped with the pickled onions and any additional toppings you like.

## Notes 

From New York Times Cooking. 

We use regular onion, add cauliflower, and add fried eggs. We don't usually do the pickled onions, though that would be yummy.
