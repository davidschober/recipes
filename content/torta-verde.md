## Ingredients 

Dough:

* 3 cups flour
* 1 cup warm water
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 T salt

Inside:

* 2 big bunches Swiss chard chopped and steamed. Can substitute spinach
* 4 small-med zucchini, shredded
* 1/2 bag frozen or 2 cans artichokes chopped fine
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or Romano)
* Handful of rice

## Directions 

Dough:

* Mix until smooth dough forms
* Flour surface to roll out dough; divide dough
* Roll out 2 sheets to fit pan top and bottom
  * Bottom sheet is larger than first and should cover the pan with some dough hanging over the sides
  * Top sheet is a little larger than pan
* Oil pan and add cornmeal then add bottom sheet and have some hang over
* Mix inside ingredients all together
* Add inside ingredients to pan, put top dough on and fold over bottom sheet edges with top sheet to form crust
* Make holes in the top to let air escape
* Top generously with olive oil
* Bake until golden brown 35/40 min. 350-400 degrees
* Other notes say 400 degrees, 45 minutes. 
* Shake the pan; torta shouldn't stick when it's done because of the cornmeal

## Notes 

We have several recipes and notes for torta verde. The above recipe should be for one large rectangular pan. But it doesn't list oil in the insides - according to notes, there should be oil, like 3/4-1 cup olive oil.

The chard and artichokes should be chopped, then steamed. The zucchini should be shredded and used raw (I think). Water should be squeezed out of the veggies after steaming.

For the dough, start with a mound of flour with a hole in middle. Add salt, add oil. Start mixing with hands, adding water a little at a time. Use a dough scraper. Mix until smooth ball. Cover. Not sure how long to let sit.
