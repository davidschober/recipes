ingredients: |-
  Dough:

  * 3 cups flour
  * 1 cup warm water
  * 3/4 cup oil
  * 1 T salt

  Inside:

  * 2 big bunches Swiss chard chopped and steamed. Can substitute spinach
  * 4 small-med zucchini, shredded
  * 1/2 bag frozen or 2 cans artichokes chopped fine
  * 3 eggs
  * 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or Romano)
  * Handful of rice
notes: |-
  We have several recipes and notes for torta verde. The above recipe should be for one large rectangular pan. But it doesn't list oil in the insides - according to notes, there should be oil, like 3/4-1 cup olive oil.

  The chard and artichokes should be chopped, then steamed. The zucchini should be shredded and used raw (I think). Water should be squeezed out of the veggies after steaming.

  For the dough, start with a mound of flour with a hole in middle. Add salt, add oil. Start mixing with hands, adding water a little at a time. Use a dough scraper. Mix until smooth ball. Cover. Not sure how long to let sit.
