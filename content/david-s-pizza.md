notes: |-
  David's note: We have unfinished terra cotta tiles permanently in our oven that we use as the pizza stone

  * Uncooked dough can be frozen (once divided)

  Topping ideas:

  * Sauce and cheese
  * Potato, cheese, rosemary - saute the thinly sliced potatoes in olive oil. Add to pizza, top with cheese, sprinkle with chopped rosemary
  * Cooked sliced onion (in olive oil), Kale slightly cooked in pan. Kale gets kinda crispy on the pizza.
  * Pesto, avocado, salad, topped with olive oil and salt
  * Fresh tomato, avocado, and salad with olive oil and salt
