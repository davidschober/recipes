Ingredients

6 egg whites (see Note)

¾ cup sugar, 6 egg yolks

½ cup unsweetened cocoa

1½ teaspoons vanilla extract

Dash salt

Confectioners' sugar

FILLING

¼ cup unsweetened cocoa

2 teaspoons instant coffee

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1½ cups heavy cream, chilled

½ cup confectioners' sugar

Candied cherries, angelica

Note: Let egg whites warm to room temperature -about 1 hour. You may make the Chocolate Log a week

ahead, then freeze it, wrapped in foil. Let stand at room temperature to thaw for about 1 hour before serving.

Directions

Grease bottom of a 15½-by-10½-by-1-inch jelly roll pan; line with waxed paper; grease lightly.

Preheat the oven to 375F. In a large electric-mixer bowl, at high speed, beat egg whites just until soft peaks form when the beater is slowly raised. 

2 Add ¼ cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until stiff peaks form when beater is slowly raised With same beaters, beat yolks at high speed, adding remaining ½ cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time.

Beat until mixture is very thick-about 4 minutes

3 At low speed, beat in cocoa, vanilla and salt, just until smooth. With wire whisk or rubber scraper, using an under-and-over motion, gently fold the cocoa mixture into the beaten egg whites, just until they are blended (no egg white should show).

4 Spread evenly in pan. Bake 15 minutes, just until surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip. Sift confectioners' sugar, in a 15- by-10-inch rectangle, on clean linen towel. Turn cake out on sugar; lift off pan; peel paper off cake.

5 Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, starting with the short end, towel and all. Cool completely on rack, seam side down-at least ½ hour. To make the filling: Combine ingredients in medium bowl. Beat with electric mixer until thick, and then refrigerate.

6 Unroll cake; spread with filling to 1 inch from edge; reroll. Place, seam side down, on plate; cover loosely with foil. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving. 

To serve: Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar; decorate with angelica and cherries. Serves 10.
