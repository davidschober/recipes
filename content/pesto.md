## Description

Pesto can be made and frozen. If frozen do not add cheese or nuts; you can add those later, if you want.

## Ingredients

* Basil
* Olive oil
* Garlic, multiple cloves
* Salt
* Parmesan cheese (optional)
* Pine nuts (optional)

## Directions

* Mix together in food processor
* Use right away or store in refrigerator (add oil to cover); or freeze
* When ready to use, warm up, add to pasta with a square of butter. Cheese can be added to individual plates. Stephanie uses Nutritional Yeast and salt to replace cheese.
* Grandma Giordano used to use ice trays to freeze, then transfer to freezer bag
